# Openstack for running medium-size simulations

When your own laptop (or personal Desktop) is insufficient for running small or medium-size simulations, and running on an HPC national infrastructure ([Notur](https://www.sigma2.no/content/high-performance-computing)), openstack appears to be a natural and simple solution.

However, be aware that the amount of resources on this new service is rather limited and you may have to migrate your work to a Notur facility.
